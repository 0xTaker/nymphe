# Nymphe (TypeScript) - Boilerplate for JSON-RPC Web Applications

Nymphe is a boilerplate that standardises the development of web-based JSON-RPC applications like that of:
- [Orderflow Auctions](https://frontier.tech/the-orderflow-auction-design-space)
- [ERC-4337 bundlers](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)
- [Block Builders](https://www.titanbuilder.xyz/docs)

...and other RPC-based applications.

A standard interface across Websockets and HTTP and across multiple clients that build on top of this  boilerplate makes it easier for users, dApps, SDKs and searchers to connect and switch between these applications, lowering switching cost.
